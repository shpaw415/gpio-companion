  Orange Pi GPIO header mapping for gpio-companion. Use when hardware is
  orangepi, wiring a breadboard/PCB, or driving GPIO. Orange Pi 3 LTS is a
  26-pin header (not 40). Power/GND seats match Pi positions; SoC lines are
  NOT BCM. Talk physical pin numbers. 3.3V logic.

# Orange Pi GPIO pinout

Logic is **3.3V**. Do not feed 5V into a GPIO. Do not short 3V3 to 5V.

Pin numbers are **physical** (the header seats you can see). They are **not** Raspberry Pi BCM numbers.

gpio-companion **Orange Pi 3 LTS** boards use a **26-pin** header. That map is below. Other Orange Pi models: see [Other Orange Pi boards](#other-orange-pi-boards).

## Safety

- Start an LED on physical **7** with a series resistor to GND (pin 6 or 9).
- Do not use pins **8** and **10** for projects — they are often the serial console.
- This 26-pin header has **no analog input**. analogRead is not available.
- PWM and tone (fade an LED, drive a buzzer) work on any GPIO through gpio-companion.

## Orange Pi 3 LTS — 26-pin header

Orient the board with the header on the board edge. Pin 1 (3V3) is top-left. There are **no pins 27–40**.

GND: 6, 9, 14, 20, 25. 3V3: 1, 17. 5V: 2, 4.

I2C: pins 3/5 and 11/13. SPI: 19/21/23/24. Good jumpers: **7, 12, 16, 18, 22**.

On Project, Live GPIO shows these names on the header. Tap a pin there to drive it.

## Other Orange Pi boards

On Pi-style 2×20 headers, **physical power and ground seats match the Raspberry Pi**. GPIO functions do not — never use BCM numbers.

Some models are **26-pin** (or 26+13). If the silkscreen stops at 26, ignore physical 27–40.

Use Live GPIO on Project (or ask the on-device agent) for the map of *this* board. Pins the companion cannot resolve cannot be driven.

## For the on-device agent

Load when `/etc/gpio-companion/config.json` has `"hardware": "orangepi"`, or `/proc/device-tree/model` contains Orange Pi.

1. `GET http://127.0.0.1:4150/v1/gpio` first — that snapshot is the live map (physical, name, dir, value, PWM). Do not rediscover with WiringOP or `gpioset`.
  2. Drive header GPIO with a C sketch (skill `gpio-host`, **physical** pins). Never BCM. `PUT /v1/gpio` only for a one-shot test: `{ "physical": 7, "dir": "out", "value": 1 }`. analogWrite/tone in C, or skill `gpio-pwm` for a test. Breadboard: `gpio-breadboard`.
3. Technical sheets: **physical pin + name** (pin 7 / PD22), never a Pi BCM number. Push `technical/` and `breadboard/diagram.json`.
4. Refuse power, GND, and `unresolved` pins. On 3 LTS ignore 27–40. analogRead only if the snapshot has `adc` (3 LTS header has none).
5. Family boards without a SKU map: only drive pins the snapshot does not mark unresolved.
