# Raspberry Pi GPIO pinout

Use this map whenever a circuit connects to the Raspberry Pi header. You do not need to memorize it: find the physical pin number, check its purpose, and wire with the power off.

## The two facts to remember

1. GPIO uses **3.3 V logic**. Never feed 5 V into a GPIO or connect 3.3 V directly to 5 V.
2. gpio-companion uses **physical pin numbers**: the numbered holes you can see. A BCM number is only another name for the signal.

## Find pin 1

On a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5, place the board with the 40-pin header on the right and the USB/Ethernet sockets toward you. **Pin 1** is the top-left header pin and carries 3.3 V.

The odd physical numbers run down one side; the even numbers run down the other. Always check the board orientation before counting.

## Safety

- Start an LED on physical **11** or **7**, with a **220 Ω to 1 kΩ resistor** in series to GND (pin 6 or 9).
- Do not use pins **27** and **28** — they are the HAT EEPROM.
- Pins **8** and **10** are UART TX/RX — often the serial console; avoid for projects.
- 5V is on pins 2 and 4 — never wire that into a GPIO.

## Try your first LED

With the board powered off:

1. Connect physical pin **11** to a resistor.
2. Connect the resistor to the LED's long leg.
3. Connect the LED's short leg to GND on physical pin **9**.
4. Compare the circuit with the breadboard diagram from the agent.
5. Restore power and use **Run on board** to start the blinking sketch.

If the LED does not light, disconnect power and turn the LED around. LEDs only conduct in one direction.

## Common jobs

- **Ordinary digital input/output:** start with 7, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 22, 29, 31, 36, 37, 38, or 40.
- **I2C sensors and displays:** pins 3 and 5.
- **SPI devices:** pins 19, 21, 23, 24, and sometimes 26.
- **Hardware PWM:** pins 12, 32, and 33 are convenient choices.
- **Ground:** 6, 9, 14, 20, 25, 30, 34, or 39.

On **Project → Board tools → Live GPIO**, choose **Companion** to see this header. Tap a safe GPIO to reveal its temporary test controls. Use **Run on board** for lasting behavior.

## Agent reference

The remainder is for the on-device agent. Bench users can stop here.

Load when `/etc/gpio-companion/config.json` has `"hardware": "raspberrypi"`, or `/proc/device-tree/model` contains Raspberry Pi.

1. `GET http://127.0.0.1:4150/v1/gpio` first — that snapshot is the live map (physical, name, dir, value, PWM).
2. **C-first:** `GET /v1/arduino-proxy` first. If connected, skill `gpio-arduino-proxy` (Arduino pins, `host/arduino-proxy-<name>/`) — not this header. Else drive header GPIO with a C sketch (skill `gpio-host`, **physical** pins). Never BCM in the body. Blink/PWM/tone/loops go to `POST /v1/run`. `PUT /v1/gpio` only for a one-shot test the user asked for: `{ "physical": 11, "dir": "out", "value": 1 }`. analogWrite/tone in C, or skill `gpio-pwm` for a test. Breadboard: `gpio-breadboard`.
3. Technical sheets: **physical pin + name** so the user can see the header. Push `technical/` and `breadboard/diagram.json`.
4. Refuse power, GND, and physical 27–28. Do not `gpioset`.
