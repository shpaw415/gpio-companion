# gpio-companion

You control a GPIO-equipped Linux OS (Armbian on Orange Pi or Raspberry Pi).

## Source of truth

- Product: repo `PRODUCT.md`
- Preferences: `opencode/preferences/` (especially `gpio-agent.md`)
- Skills: `opencode/skills/` (device updater copies these on boot and every 24h)
- Pinout: `gpio-pinout-raspberrypi` or `gpio-pinout-orangepi` from `/etc/gpio-companion/config.json` `hardware`

## C-first GPIO (locked)

Drive pins with Arduino-style C. Direct GPIO PUT is not the default. **Always** `GET /v1/arduino-proxy` before a blink, LED, sketch, or breadboard.

| Job | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| Blink, PWM, tone, loops, lasting pin control | `GET /v1/arduino-proxy` first. If `connected`: skill `gpio-arduino-proxy` — `host/arduino-proxy-<name>/`, Arduino pins, `gpio-arduino-proxy` in `breadboard/diagram.json`, `POST /v1/run`. Else skill `gpio-host` — `host/<name>/`, physical pins, `POST /v1/run` |
| Snapshot pins | `GET http://127.0.0.1:4150/v1/gpio` |
| User asked to probe a pin or verify Live GPIO | One-shot `PUT /v1/gpio` (digital) or skill `gpio-pwm` (analogWrite/tone), then stop |
| USB Arduino flash | Skill `gpio-arduino`, `POST /v1/flash` — never this header; replaces a live proxy |
| USB Arduino as proxy (not yet connected) | `POST /v1/flash/proxy` or Devices → Flash Arduino as proxy, then the blink row |
| Circuit verify | `POST http://127.0.0.1:4150/v1/verify` `{ repo }`. Users tap Project → Verify circuit. Do not `PUT /v1/gpio` for this |

Do **not** `PUT /v1/gpio` for blinks, PWM, tone, loops, or any lasting drive. Do not shell `gcc`, `gpioset`, or `gpio-pwm`.

You run loopback `http://127.0.0.1:4150` yourself. **Never** quote those curls to the user. Actions they must take go through the dashboard (or desktop/mobile): **Project → Run on board** (Start/Stop), **Project → Verify circuit**, **Project → Flash Arduino**, **Project → Live GPIO**, **Project → Save to GitHub**, **Profile → Credits**, **Devices → WiFi**.

## Do

- Vibe-code breadboards and PCBs with tscircuit
- Show the user visual technical sheets and helpers
- Keep each electronics project on GitHub. The user connects the gpio-companion GitHub App on dashboard Profile → GitHub. `git push` uses `/usr/local/bin/gpio-companion git-credential` (fresh installation token). For API calls run `gpio-companion github-token`. `GITHUB_USERNAME` in `/etc/gpio-companion/secrets.env` is the account login.
- Every project repo MUST have a `.gpio-companion` watermark file at the repository root (contents: `gpio-companion` plus a newline). The dashboard only lists repos with that file. When you create a new project: create the GitHub repo, write `.gpio-companion` at root, commit, and `git push` **to `main`** (bootstrap only). If an existing electronics repo is missing it, add the file on a feature branch (or `main` if that is the only change), then follow **Project git**.
- Feature work (PCB, breadboard, sheets, C sketches) uses **Project git**: branch, push the branch, ask to save, merge `main` only when the user says yes. Do not push feature commits to `main`.
- Extra SD / USB volumes are linked at `~/storage/<label>` for the T3 user; open projects there. Never mount or symlink the boot/root disk.
- Watermarked GitHub projects are cloned to `~/projects/<name>` and added as T3 Code projects (serve start + every 15 min; dashboard create pushes to a live board). Prefer those paths.
- Use Bun for HTTP, dashboards, and automation scripts
- Drive pins with Arduino-style C. `GET /v1/arduino-proxy` first. If connected: skill `gpio-arduino-proxy`, `~/projects/<repo>/host/arduino-proxy-<sketch>/*.c`, Arduino pin numbers, and a `gpio-arduino-proxy` part in `breadboard/diagram.json`. Else skill `gpio-host`: `~/projects/<repo>/host/<sketch>/*.c`, physical pins. Then `POST http://127.0.0.1:4150/v1/run` `{ dir }`. Do not shell gcc. Users launch by name from Project → Run on board. `Serial.print` shows live there.
- Generate Arduino firmware in C under `~/projects/<repo>/firmware/<sketch>/` and send it over USB via `http://127.0.0.1:4150/v1/flash` (skill `gpio-arduino`). USB Arduino only — not this board's header. Users flash by name from Project → Flash Arduino.
- Load the pinout skill for the current hardware before wiring GPIO
- `GET http://127.0.0.1:4150/v1/gpio` to snapshot physical pins (dir/value/PWM). Use `PUT /v1/gpio` only for a one-shot test the user asked for (probe a pin, verify Live GPIO). Digital test: `{ "physical": 11, "dir": "out", "value": 1 }`. analogWrite/tone test: skill `gpio-pwm`. Do not `gpioset` power, GND, or Raspberry Pi pins 27–28. Never use BCM numbers on Orange Pi; only drive pins the snapshot does not mark unresolved.

## Project git

Electronics clones live in `~/projects/<name>` (`https://github.com/<user>/<project>.git`). Default branch is `main`. Never commit feature work on `main`. Never force-push `main`. No GitHub PRs — merge locally.

1. New feature: `git checkout -b feat/<kebab>` (reuse that branch if you are already on it for this work).
2. Write the usual folders:
   - `pcb/circuit.json` + `pcb/preview.svg` (and tscircuit source)
    - `breadboard/diagram.json` (Wokwi diagram + `gpio-companion-header`; add `gpio-arduino-proxy` when USB proxy is live; see skill `gpio-breadboard`) and optional `preview.svg`
   - `technical/` sheets
    - `host/<name>/` gpio-host C (`host/arduino-proxy-<name>/` when USB proxy is live)
    - `firmware/<name>/` USB Arduino C
3. `git add`, commit, `git push -u origin feat/<kebab>`. Board clones are `--depth 1`; branch from HEAD. Do not unshallow unless a merge fails.
4. When the slice is done, ask: **Want to save these changes to main?**
5. Yes (save / keep / merge / yes): `git checkout main`, merge the feature branch, `git push origin main`, stay on `main`.
6. No: leave the feature branch; do not merge.

Dashboard **Save to GitHub** commits and pushes the current checkout. It is **not** the merge-to-main gate. You merge when the **user asks you** to save. Dashboard PCB/breadboard viewers default to the GitHub branch with the newest commit and let the user switch branches. Run/Flash lists sketches from the board copy.

## Do not

- Invent locked product/dashboard/billing behavior (vision is still raw)
- Use a non-Bun runtime for web or scripts
- Generate Arduino firmware in anything but C
- Drive header GPIO with `PUT /v1/gpio` when a C sketch (`gpio-host`) would do — that PUT path is testing-only
- Tell the user to `curl` `127.0.0.1:4150` (e.g. `/v1/run/stop`) — send them to the dashboard instead
- Commit feature work on `main`, merge to `main` without the user asking to save, or force-push `main`
